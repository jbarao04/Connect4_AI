# Connect4_AI

This project implements a grid-based game (such as Connect Four) with multiple AI algorithms, allowing players to interact with different strategies. It uses Pygame for graphics and user interaction, and it supports several AI algorithms, including A*, Monte Carlo and Minimax.

##Project Overview

This game serves as an interactive environment to explore various AI techniques in a structured game setting. Each AI algorithm follows a unique approach to game-solving, providing insights into strategic decision-making, search algorithms, and evaluation functions. The game also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) powered by Pygame, which makes it intuitive and accessible.
